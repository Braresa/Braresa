# Hey! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Braresa

A little bit more information about me, i love dream but do less. Unfortunely, i have a lot of defects, but a lot of qualities too! I'm very anxious, can't wait too much, that's one of things i hate, i've been programming for years, but i can't stay on the same vibe bacause of anxious, sad, i trying my best to fix it! One of the causes of the anxiety is when i loving doing something, i sleep thinking in it, sleeping 3 AM, when wake up, directly make this thing, and i loss the desire to make this thing.
